# Investigating airplane accidents

Using Python, analyzed airplane accidents data spanning over a time period of more than 30 years. Used several search algorithms to traverse through the entire dataset with more than 75000 rows, and tried to answer some interesting questions.

## Files

| File name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| [airplane_accidents.py](airplane_accidents.py) | Main code with all of the search algorithms and analyses |
| [AviationData.txt](AviationData.txt) | Text file with airplane accident data spanning more than 30 years starting backwards from 2015 |
| [environment.yml](environment.yml) | Conda environment required to run this code |
| [NextSteps.txt](NextSteps.txt) | Text file containing ideas for further analysis |

## Setup

- You must have [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) installed to run this code.
- Create a conda environment using [environment.yml](environment.yml) YAML file. More help on this can be found [here](https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html#use-environment-from-file).
